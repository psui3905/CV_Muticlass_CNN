# README

* `cd Algorithm` then `python3 predict.py`

* You can change some default parameters for the prediction such as the number of samples you want to predict

* Make sure you don't change the `LABELS` in `CONFIG.py` unless you know what you are doing
  * The model did not specify the class-label dictionary during training, the given dictionary is generated by the library

  * If you retrained the model, you can use the following code to get the new library if you forgot to specify:` your_generator.class_indices()`

* Only the predict code is given, which can be found in `predict.py`

* Also, if you want to use some other trained model with the `predict.py` , make sure you specify the custom objects correctly.

* Enjoy ðŸ˜ƒ
